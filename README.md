How To Play
Reduce your opponent's health to 0 using your
light, medium, and heavy attacks before
your opponent does to win the game. Hold the back
button to block the opponent's attacks reducing
the damage you will take. Be mindful of walking
backwards too much, hitting the end wall
will do damage to you. Use the light attack
up close to pressure your opponent. This
attack does not do much damage, but leaves
you in an advantageous state, allowing you
to attack without the opponent being able to use
their attacks. Use the medium attack as your
primary way to do high damage to your
opponent from up close. This attack will combo
into itself, so use multiple medium attacks in
your combo. Use the heavy attack to hit your
opponent from afar. This attack is slow, but
deals high damage. This attack will also extend
your hurtbox quite a bit, so if you see your opponent
miss with this attack, use one of your faster attacks
to land a hit from afar. Use jumps to advance and 
retreat quickly, but be careful as you take
increased damage if hit from the air. A jumping
attack is performed by pressing the heavy attack
button from the air. You can use a jumping attack
to fly over slower attacks and start your combos
from up close. A jumping attack can be countered
by using your medium attack because is will shrink
your hurtbox vertically as well as having a high
vertical hitbox. This will allow you to swat your
opponent out of the air for increased damage.
A special ranged attack can be performed by pressing
down, down-forward, forward, and then any attack
button. This attack can reach your opponent even
if they are on the other side of the stage! Pressing
light, medium, and heavy will result in different
versions of the attack being used. Use the light
version to launch a slow shuriken. This does the
least damage of the three versions, but is powerful
because it allows you to follow it to cover your
approach. The medium version has a shorter start-up
time compared to the others and will combo when used
as a special cancel. The heavy version is the fastest
and is the hardest to react to. All versions of this
attack can be used in a special cancel. Use a standard
attack and then immediately input the special attack
to cancel the standard attack animation and start
the special attack to either combo or keep up the
pressure. Be careful if this attack is blocked at
close range though because it will let your opponent
attack you while you are still recovering from the
special attack. When you see the super meter full,
you can execute your super attack! This can be
done by pressing down, down-forward, forward, down,
down-forward, forward and then any attack button.
This attack is invincible when it starts allowing
you to counter if the opponent is too aggressive.
This can also be canceled into from a special move
in similar manner special cancels are performed.
Cancel a normal attack into a special attack into
the super attack for massive damage!
